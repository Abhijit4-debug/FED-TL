Welcome to the **FED-TL** project repository! This project focuses on implementing **Federated Learning (FL)** with **Transfer Learning (TL)** to enhance network intrusion detection using the CSE-CICIDS 2018 dataset.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 📖 What is FED-TL?
FED-TL combines Federated Learning and Transfer Learning to:
- Enable collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing sensitive data.
- Improve detection accuracy for rare and zero-day attacks in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).
- Reduce computation and communication costs by leveraging transfer learning.
