Welcome to the **FED-TL** project repository! This project focuses on implementing **Federated Learning (FL)** with **Transfer Learning (TL)** to enhance network intrusion detection using the CSE-CICIDS 2018 dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 📖 What is FED-TL?
FED-TL combines Federated Learning and Transfer Learning to:
- Enable collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing sensitive data.
- Improve detection accuracy for rare and zero-day attacks in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).
- Reduce computation and communication costs by leveraging transfer learning.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Here’s what you’ll find in this repository:
- **`cic-ids_data_loader/`**: Contains preprocessed and distributed versions of the CSE-CICIDS 2018 dataset.
- **`CSE-CICIDS2018/`**: Implementation Python scripts for training, evaluation of the FL-TL models, including 4 clients adn 1 server.
- **`cic-ids_dataset.rar/`**: Contains all the files of CSE-CICIDS Dataset. Dataloader is in "cic-ids_data_loader/", it generates required datasets for clients and server.
